# Accessing Your Tebex Assets
There are two ways you can access your assets after you've purchased them through Tebex.

From this email you can simply click the `Download Your Asset` button to download the zip file containing your asset. After you've downloaded your asset please proceed to the install documentation for the script you've downloaded.
### Keymaster
First you'll need to access and sign in to Keymaster with the account that is associated with the CFX name you provided during Tebex checkout. [You can access Keymaster here.](https://keymaster.fivem.net)

After you've logged in click on the `Purchased Assets` button at the top.![button-example.png](/button-example.png)
