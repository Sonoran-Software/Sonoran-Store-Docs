### Where can I find vehicle livery/lighting/texture templates?

For templates available you will find a `Templates` folder in the keymaster resource download. If there is not a template for your desired vehicle, there is not one available for that vehicle at this time. All Redneck Mods vehicles have been updated on `January 10th, 2023` to have the complete list of available templates.

### Are Redneck Mods Liveries/EUP/Sirens Included in Five Bundle?

Not currently, no. These are not considered FiveMâ„¢ specific assets and are not distributed via the CFX.re Keymaster/Escrow system. These assets may be purchased individually at [redneckmods.com](https://www.redneckmods.com/category/dev-assets).

### My Five Bundle charges are still $49.99 after the price drop to $29.99. How can I get the lower price?

Due to Tebex limitations, you'll need to re-subscribe to secure this new rate. To avoid any disruption, we recommend waiting until your current term ends before making the switch. Your uninterrupted access and satisfaction are our top priorities.

### Cancelations and Refunds

#### Where can I cancel my subscription?

Customers may cancel their Five Bundle subscription at anytime via [Tebex.io's System](https://checkout.tebex.io/payment-history/) or via cancellation link included in the original purchase and subscription renewal emails. All assets will remain available until the end of the current subscription term.

#### If I cancel my subscription do I keep the content?

All items in the Five Bundle are protected via Tebex and CFX's asset escrow encryption system. Due to Tebex limitations, all assets are immediately revoked upon cancellation and are not available for the remainder of the term.

#### Where can I request a refund?

[Refunds are offered within 48 hours of any purchase or renewal](https://sonoransoftware.com/assets/files/internal/purchase\_policy.pdf). Refunds must be requested on the support.sonoransoftware.com portal. Requesting a refund will revoke access to all Five Bundle content immediately.
