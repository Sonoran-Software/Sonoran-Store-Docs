# Introduction
This Internal reference includes a dynamic and ever growing list of tools and external resources/guides to help you learn and master certain elements of development. Primarily these resources revolve around advanced topics such as...
- GTA 3D asset development
- GTA 3D Interior development (MLOs, YMAPs, etc)
- GTA 3D Clothing/Ped development (EUP)
- GTA 3D Vehicle development
- Advanced typically obscure GTA scripting development techniques

As you learn something new, please take a moment and document it! We only benefit from eachother's knowledge (past, present and future team members) if we take the short amount of time to document it. Happy developing!!! ╰(*°▽°*)╯
