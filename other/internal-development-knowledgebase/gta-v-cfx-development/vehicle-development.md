## Vehicle Development (WIP) <a href="#vehicle-development-wip" id="vehicle-development-wip"></a>

### Tools <a href="#tools" id="tools"></a>

The main tools needed to create or edit vehicles.

#### [OpenIV](https://openiv.com/) or [CodeWalker](https://github.com/dexyfex/CodeWalker) <a href="#openiv-or-codewalker" id="openiv-or-codewalker"></a>

Both applications are meant to open the game files and edit them as well, thus allowing the developer to use existing in game models or enables them to export in order edit or modify accordingly to their needs.

#### [ZModeler 3](https://www.zmodeler3.com/) <a href="#zmodeler-3" id="zmodeler-3"></a>

Main tool used in order to create, modify or model assets to be used in game. ZModeler3 or ZMod as it shall be referred to further is also capable of exporting assets for other games as well (SCS Software truck sims, Mafia or The Sims 3) however it is the primary tool of a vehicle developer.

#### [blender](https://www.blender.org/), [Autodesk 3DS Max](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview?term=1-YEAR\&tab=subscription), [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR\&tab=subscription) or other 3d modeling programs <a href="#blender-autodesk-3ds-max-autodesk-maya-or-other-3d-modeling-programs" id="blender-autodesk-3ds-max-autodesk-maya-or-other-3d-modeling-programs"></a>

These various programs accomplish the same task, modeling assets from scratch or modifying existing meshes in order to serve to the use of the developer.

#### [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) or anything that allows for easy code editing <a href="#notepad-or-anything-that-allows-for-easy-code-editing" id="notepad-or-anything-that-allows-for-easy-code-editing"></a>

This program's use is to edit the various metas needed (especially in the case of FiveM where these metas are needed in order to stream the vehicle).

#### [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/ro/products/photoshop.html?skwcid=AL!3085!3!341189891175!e!!g!!photoshop\&mv=search\&sdid=LZ32SYVR\&ef\_id=CjwKCAjw0a-SBhBkEiwApljU0np-kh2Z3ZqeE01zPYkcM-NeatQS5s9pIYeDv1lZqwC7BEhq9-ehThoC91AQAvD\_BwE:G:s\&s\_kwcid=AL!3085!3!341189891175!e!!g!!photoshop!1474801599!59875018489\&gclid=CjwKCAjw0a-SBhBkEiwApljU0np-kh2Z3ZqeE01zPYkcM-NeatQS5s9pIYeDv1lZqwC7BEhq9-ehThoC91AQAvD\_BwE), [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) or any image editing software <a href="#photoshop-paintnet-or-any-image-editing-software" id="photoshop-paintnet-or-any-image-editing-software"></a>

These programs are used in order to manipulate textures or in the case of emergency vehicles create a skin/livery.

### Websites <a href="#websites" id="websites"></a>

There are various websites that offer free assets to developers as well as paid assets, there are also discord servers of various developers that sell assets or that have them posted there but not on a website.

#### [LCPDFR](https://www.lcpdfr.com/downloads/dev-resources/) <a href="#lcpdfr" id="lcpdfr"></a>

One of the oldest in this list, LCPDFR has one of the biggest selection of development assets.

#### [GTAPOLICEMODS](https://gtapolicemods.com/files/category/11-dev-support/) <a href="#gtapolicemods" id="gtapolicemods"></a>

This site is growing at a steady place and is a very good starting ground although it does not have all the base models you may need posted. Also it has a marketplace where you can buy or sell different mods and models.
